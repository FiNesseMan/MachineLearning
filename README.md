Machine Learning Project Final Report
This repository contains the final report for a comprehensive machine learning project that encompasses the full lifecycle of a practical, applied machine learning endeavor. The project has been divided into three key components: Analytic Plan, Preliminary Results, and this Final Report.

Overview
The primary objective of this machine learning project is to simulate the real-world experience of a data scientist, working through the entire process of solving a complex problem for a client. In this context, the Final Report represents the ultimate deliverable to the client, summarizing the key findings, insights, and recommendations derived from the earlier phases of the project (Analytic Plan and Preliminary Results).

The Final Report is characterized by its broader scope, as it integrates and expands upon the work presented in the Analytic Plan and Preliminary Results. It includes restated data preparation and feature engineering steps, a comparison of at least two dense neural network models using ROC curves, AUC, and calibration plots, and the selection of a final model that effectively addresses the stated business needs. Additionally, it discusses how this model can be practically employed to meet the client's objectives.
